        <p>Welcome to the Course Management System for the University of Doha for Science and Technology (UDST). This
            platform is designed to assist the Head of Department in managing student requests efficiently during the
            initial week of classes.</p>
        <p>Many students face issues such as course registration problems, section changes, or requests for capstone
            registration. Our goal is to provide a streamlined system that allows students to submit their requests
            without the need to visit the office in person, thus reducing the burden on the department head.</p>
        <h3>Our Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide a platform for students to submit course registration and section change requests.</li>
            <li>Allow the department head to efficiently process and manage these requests.</li>
            <li>Reduce office traffic by handling requests digitally and notifying the department head of necessary
                actions.</li>
        </ul>
